# MDA
Syntetic simulation of path finding problems of Magen David Adom (MDA) with Heurystic Search Algorithms.

## About:
> This experimental project was part of Introduction to A.I. course assignments which focuses on Heurystic Search Algorithms.
> The setting is completely synthetic and made to simulate a path finding problem of an ambulance vehicle with emphasis on
> optimization of the solution with respect to various criteria and limitations such as: patients and laboratories distributions on the map,  
> ambulance capacity, fueal consumption etc.
> The description of the problem is given in the assignment_description.pdf while the solution and experimental results are presented in the
> assignment_solution.pdf.

## Structure:
> framework/graph_search presents several heurystic based search algorithms implemented in the generic way.
> main.py defines and runs various experiments.
> problems folder contains costs and various heurystics of the described problem to solve.
